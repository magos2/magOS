#### Les Interruptions ###
* Miscellaneous
  - when an interrupt is handled, IF flag is cleared, which disable maskable interrupts.
  
* Interrupt Types:
 - Hardware interrupts

    NMI: non maskable, received on the processor's NMI# input pin.
    INTR: maskable(ignored) if 'IF' flag is clear. received on the processor's INTR# input pin.
    Exceptions: they occur when the processor detect an error while executing an instruction(division by 0, page fault, gpf,etc)
 - Software interrupt: generated by "INT n" instruction.

* IDT: table of 256 vectors. 
  0-31 vectors are asigned to NMI and exceptions. non-maskable.
  32-47 are asigned to material interrupts(IRQ). maskable.
  48-255 are available for kernel. maskable.
